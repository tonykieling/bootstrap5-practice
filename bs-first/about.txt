- bootstrap instalation by npm, so it can be customized.

# npm i bootstrap@5.0.0-alpha1
# npm i bootstrap-icons

- the customization has to be made on the project's own directory, instead of directly in the boostrap one because if bootstrap is updated, it will overwrite the customization.


- key points:
  - installing bootstrap5 by npm
  - bootstrap icons
  - utilities
  - custom properties
  - popper is needed for tooltips and popovers. It may be instaleed in the same bundle or in a separated one. Also, we may not need it.
  - the video approached also some diff btw v4 and v5 and the new features of v5
